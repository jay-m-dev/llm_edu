# Core Game Fantasy

## Core Fantasy Statement
You are a playful LLM architect, tuning a toy-but-faithful model by running experiments, watching it fail, and iterating with purpose.

## Core Player Verbs
- Tune
- Test
- Inspect

## Tone Keywords
- Playful
- Curious
- Precise
- Non-punitive
- Experimental

## Mechanic -> LLM Concept Mapping
- Tune -> Parameter control (temperature, context size, sampling)
- Test -> Run generation with deterministic replay
- Inspect -> Visualize tokens, attention, probabilities, and context window

## MVP Promise
- A hands-on, visual sandbox for understanding LLM behaviors through short, repeatable experiments.
- Every mechanic maps to a real concept (tokenization, attention, context limits, sampling).
- Failure is informative, not punitive, and always replayable.

## MVP Non-Goals
- No real training or inference libraries.
- No GPU or heavy math.
- No multiplayer or social features.
- No accounts, auth, or monetization.
- No backend services required for core gameplay.
